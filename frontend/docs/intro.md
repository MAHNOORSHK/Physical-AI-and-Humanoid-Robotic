# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

##  Course Overview

**Focus:** AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

**Goal:** Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions.

---

##  What You'll Learn

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This course introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

### Core Technologies

- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System) - The nervous system
- **Gazebo & Unity** - Physics simulation and rendering
- **NVIDIA Isaac** - AI-powered perception and training
- **Vision-Language-Action** (VLA) - Natural interaction with LLMs

---

##  Course Structure

This course is organized into **4 comprehensive modules**:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
⏱ **Duration:** Weeks 3-5 (3 weeks)

Learn the middleware that powers modern robots. Master nodes, topics, services, and Python integration with rclpy.

**[Start Module 1 →](./module-01-ros2/chapter-01-ros2-architecture)**

---

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
⏱ **Duration:** Weeks 6-7 (2 weeks)

Master physics simulation and environment building. Create realistic digital replicas with Gazebo and photorealistic rendering with Unity.

**[Start Module 2 →](./module-02-simulation/chapter-04-gazebo-physics)**

---

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
⏱ **Duration:** Weeks 8-10 (3 weeks)

Dive into advanced perception, training, and hardware-accelerated robotics using NVIDIA's cutting-edge Isaac platform.

**[Start Module 3 →](./module-03-isaac/chapter-07-isaac-sim)**

---

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
⏱ **Duration:** Weeks 11-13 (3 weeks)

Explore the convergence of LLMs and robotics. Enable robots to understand voice commands and translate natural language into actions.

**[Start Module 4 →](./module-04-vla/chapter-11-voice-to-action)**

##  Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:

- **Share our physical form** - Can navigate human spaces naturally
- **Learn from interaction** - Abundant training data from human environments
- **Embody intelligence** - Transition from digital AI to physical reality

This represents the next frontier: **from AI models confined to screens to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.**
